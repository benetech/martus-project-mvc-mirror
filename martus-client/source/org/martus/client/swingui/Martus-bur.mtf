# Martus Client Translation File
# Language code:  bur
# Language name:  
# Translated by:
# Exported date:  Fri Apr 10 16:47:04 PDT 2015
# Client version: 5.2.0
# Client build:   2015-04-10.3524
#
# This file MUST be saved in UTF-8 format!
# Lines beginning with # are comments and are ignored by Martus
# Each entry has two lines. The first line is the current English
#    text, and the second line consists of: KEY=VALUE
#    (e.g. -c47a-button:customHelp=<Help> )
# Do not modify any KEY. Do localize every VALUE.
# Each VALUE that needs to be translated has <> around it.
#    As you translate each VALUE, remove its <>
# When a non-English VALUE appears inside <> it is because the English
#    translation has changed. Verify or update the translation to 
#    match the new English text, and remove the <>
# If there is an English VALUE inside <> , it is because it is a field
#    added after the last release. Remove the english, insert/update the
#    VALUE translation to match the new English text which is in the
#    comment line directly above it, and remove the <>
# If you name it Martus-ar.mtf, put the file in your
#     Martus directory, and create a file (which can be empty)
#     called use_unofficial_translations.txt in your Martus directory,
#     then Martus will automatically read it.  You will receive a warning
#     message when you use this file while testing.
# In Martus, to choose a language, pick one from the drop-down list
#    in the lower left-hand corner of the signin screen, or after you
#    are logged in, go to Options/Preferences.
#
#  1.  do NOT translate "\n" (used for new lines)
#      And do NOT put spaces before the  equal sign after field:xxx.
#      [should be "field:fieldtag=fieldtext" instead of
#  	   "field:fieldtag = fieldtext" (space before the equals sign)]
#  2.  do NOT create any user-entered new-lines/carriage-returns
#      (by using the enter key) in any mtf entry
#      (from the field:xxx to the end of the translated text),
#      since a continuous block of text is needed.
#  3.  in field:VirtualKeyboardKeys, keep the english alphabet, but include any
#      non-english characters at the end of the english alphabet/numbers/special
#      characters (e.g. attach entire Thai alphabet at the end of the line)
#  4.  in CreateCustomFieldsHelp2/3 fields, you can translate tags into foreign
#      characters (but without punctuation or spaces)
#  5.  when there are file or directory names, do not translate them
#      (e.g.  "acctmap.txt" and "packets"
#      in field:confirmWarnMissingAccountMapFilecause=Warning: acctmap.txt
#      file in your account's packets directory...)
#  6.  do not translate the words "Martus" or "Benetech" or "Tor"
#  7.  Leave standard field tags in English in CreateCustomFieldsHelp1 and
#      CreateCustomFieldsHelp2, but put translation in parentheses after
#      english : e.g.  'author' (translation-of-author from mtf, e.g. autor in spanish), so users know what they refer to
#  8.  Leave field types in English in CreateCustomFieldsHelp2 (e.g. BOOLEAN,
#      DATE), but put translation in parentheses after english, so users know
#      what they refer to.
#  9.  Leave field types in English in CreateCustomFieldsHelp3 examples
#      (e.g. BOOLEAN, DATE)
# 10.  In CreateCustomFieldsHelp3, do not translate words between angle brackets in the XML for custom fields, such as:
#      <Field type='SECTION'>, <Field type='STRING'>, <Field type='BOOLEAN'>, <Field type='DATE'>, 
#      <Field type='DATERANGE'>, <Field type='DROPDOWN'>, <Field type='MULTILINE'> 
#      <Field type='LANGUAGE'>, <Field type='MESSAGE'>, <Field type='GRID'>, 
#      </Field>, <Tag>, </Tag>, <Label>, </Label>,  <Message>, </Message> 
#      <Choices>, </Choices>, <Choice>, </Choice>, <DataSource>, </DataSource>
#      <GridFieldTag>, </GridFieldTag>, <GridColumnLabel>, </GridColumnLabel> 
#      <GridSpecDetails>, </GridSpecDetails>, <Column>, </Column>, 
#      <Column type='STRING'>, <Column type='BOOLEAN'>, <Column type='DATE'>,
#      <Column type='DATERANGE'>, <Column type='DROPDOWN'> 
#      <KeepWithPrevious/>, <RequiredField/>, <DefaultValue>, </DefaultValue>,
#      <MinimumDate>, </MinimumDate>, <MaximumDate>, </MaximumDate>, <MaximumDate/>.
#      For Reusable choices sections, translate anything within single quotes '...', but not  <UseReusableChoices code= , </UseReusableChoices>
#      <ReusableChoices code= , </ReusableChoices>, label= , <Choice code= . 
# 10b.  In CreateCustomFieldsHelp2, change the "ddd" in "<DefaultValue>ddd</DefaultValue>" to whatever letter the translation of "default" begins with.
# 10c.  For  CreateCustomFieldsHelp1/2/2b/3, check the User Guide section 10b to see if the text has already been translated and use the same translation for consistency.
# 11.  Do not translate words that are surrounded by #'s, but you may move
#      them around as grammatically appropriate.
#      Example: #TotalNumberOfFilesInBackup#, #Titles#, #FieldLabel#, etc.
#      as these words will be replaced when the program runs with
#      a particular value.
#      For Example. #TotalNumberOfFilesInBackup# = '5'
#                   #Titles# = 'A list of bulletin titles'
# 12.  Do not translate the numbers in the field:translationVersion string.
# 13.  Do not translate the numbers in the field:ErrorCustomFields string.
# 14.  For Thai, Afghan and Persian months, please do the following: 
#          - for Thai translation, Thai months should be the same as the translation
#            of default/Gregorian months, and Afghan and Persian dates are the same as in English.
#          - for Afghan or Persian translation, Thai and Afghan and Persian months 
#            should be the same as the translation of default/Gregorian months
#          - for Arabic translation, Thai months should be the same as 
#            the translation of default/Gregorian months, but do an Arabic translation
#            (or transliteration) of Afghan and Persian dates (not the same as in English).
#          - for all other languages, Thai and Afghan and Persian dates can be the same
#            as the translation of default/Gregorian months 
# 15       - We have file filters like 'Martus Report Format (.mrf)'
#            and 'Martus Search Specification (.mss)'.
#            The descriptive names should be translated, but the (.mrf) and (.mss)
#            must not be translated. Similarly for .html, .htm, .mba, .mpi, .xml, .mct, .jpeg, .jpg, and .dat file extensions.
# 16.  If you want your language to appear left to right,
#      Comment the next line (by adding a # in front of !right-to-left)
!right-to-left

#__________________________________=For custom (non-standard) fields, you first select the type of field you want.  The possible choices are 'BOOLEAN', 'DATE', 'DATERANGE', 'DROPDOWN', 'GRID', 'LANGUAGE', 'MESSAGE', 'MULTILINE', 'STRING', and 'SECTION'. \n\nFor each custom field you will need a unique identification tag.  This tag can be any word except those already used by the system (eg. 'author', 'summary', 'location', 'title' etc.), and cannot contain spaces or special characters.  Examples of choices are 'VictimsName', 'EyeColorChoice', etc.\n\nThen you need a label which is displayed next to your custom field.  An example might be 'Name of 1st Witness'.\n\nYou can create sections (which you can hide/unhide) in your records using a SECTION field type.  \n\nYou can put multiple fields on a single row in your record by using <KeepWithPrevious/> in the field definition.\n\nYou can require certain fields or grid columns to be entered before saving a record by using </RequiredField> in the field definition.\n\nYou can restrict standard or custom date fields, date grid columns, date range fields, and date range grid columns by using <MinimumDate> and/or <MaximumDate> tags with a date in YYYY-MM-DD format. Note: The year must always be a 'Gregorian' year like 2009, even if Martus is configured to use Thai or Afghan or Persian dates. A blank date, shown as <MaximumDate/>, means 'today', although it may allow one day earlier or later, due to time zone issues. \n\nYou can populate drop-down lists (either inside or outside of a grid) in three ways - 1) by entering a list of <Choices> values in the field definition, 2) with values that have been entered in a grid elsewhere in your record by using <DataSource> (sometimes called \"data-driven dropdowns\"), and 3) by creating a list of \"Reusable Choices\" that can be referred to by more than one field.  See examples below for the correct XML definition syntax to use.\n\nYou can set a default value for text and dropdown list fields by using <DefaultValue>ddd</DefaultValue>. For dropdowns, you must use a value already in the list of choices you defined. For Reusable Choices dropdowns it can be a partial or complete code, with each level separated by dots (for a location dropdown that has both Region and City levels, you could pick the default to be at either level, e.g. either R1 or R1.C1, see example below). Default values can be set for both standard and custom fields, but are NOT allowed for BOOLEAN, DATE, DATERANGE, GRID, LANGUAGE, MESSAGE, and SECTION field types, and are not allowed for dropdowns where the values in the list are based on data entered in another field.(i.e. data-driven dropdowns).  Please note that default values are only applied when a new record is created, not when a new version of a record is created, so that the value of the field in the previous version is not overwritten.  This means that default values entered in a record using an earlier customization will be kept even if you create a new version of the record with an updated customization that has a new default value\n\n Additional Comments\n\n1. XML is case-sensitive ('Witness' is not the same as 'witness')\n\n2. Quotes around type name can be single or double as long as they match (e.g. 'STRING\" is not valid. It must be 'STRING' or \"STRING\")\n\n3. A Boolean field will be displayed as a checkbox when editing and Yes/No when previewed or printed.\n\n4.  Use \"MESSAGE\" fields to give guidance on how to enter data, and to create comments/notes that will be displayed in every record.\n\n5.  Dropdowns using a \"Reusable Choices\" list can have multiple levels (e.g. for locations that might have Region and City), different fields can use one or more of the levels, and the number of levels is not limited.\n\n6. Both STRING and MULTILINE fields are text fields.  STRING fields will expand to fit the size of the text you enter, while MULTILINE fields have a scrollbar so that the field doesn't exceed its original height.\n\n7.  A GRID can contain columns of various types:  BOOLEAN, DATE, DATERANGE, DROPDOWN, and STRING. When you're entering data into a grid, press Enter to create a new line, press Tab to advance to the next cell, and double-click to copy and paste text.\n\n8.  You can update your customization if the information you are collecting over time changes, for example by adding new fields.  If you are changing fields in a customization, you should think about how you will want to search/report on records created with the old customization as well as new records you create with the new customization, and try to make the changes so that you can search/report on all records at the same time.  Changing field types may cause your searching/reporting to be more complex, so we always recommend that you test out creating records with a new customization and searching/reporting on both old and new records before officially updating the customization for your project.  When you change customizations, Martus will do its best to update the old formatted data to the new customization if you create a new version of a record with the old customization.  If you add completely new fields but don't change any of the old fields, the new version of the record will have all the old fields filled in as they were in the previous version, and the new fields will be blank and you can fill them in.  If you delete fields, the new version of the record will not contain those fields, but you can go back to see the deleted fields in the previous version if it was a sealed record instead of a draft (by hitting the Record Details button in the Header section of the record), and copy any info from the old version into a different field in the new one if desired.  You have to be very careful if you make changes to the customization definitions of old fields.  If you keep the same tag and label, but change the type of field, Martus may be able to transfer the old data into the new field type, but not in all cases.  For example, if you change field type from DROPDOWN to STRING, the data will be transferred over, but if you change from STRING to BOOLEAN, the data will be lost. If you change from a DATE to DATERANGE, your data will be transferred, but if you change from DATERANGE to DATE, you will lose the end date from your earlier data. DROPDOWN and GRID fields are subject to additional rules regarding the modification of dropdown options/values and grid columns. If you add options/values to a dropdown list, the old data will be transferred over. But if you modify or delete an option/value, all records for which that option was selected will lose that data. If you want to add columns to a grid, please make sure to do so at the end of the old grid definition and not in the middle, or the old data will not be transferred to the new version of the record. If you change fields and lose old data in the new version as a result, please note that you can go back to see the deleted data in the previous version if it was a sealed record instead of a draft (by hitting the Record Details button in the Header section of the record), and copy any info from the old version into a different field in the new one if desired. In this release, if you want to change the number of levels in a \"Reusable Choices\" dropdown field when updating a customization, you should also change the field tag and/or label so that they are more easily distinguished from each other in searching and reporting.  If you do not, the search/report results may be confusing since fields with the same label/tag will be treated differently due to them having a different number of levels.\n\nSee examples below and if you need additional help with customization, please email martus@benetech.org.\n\n

#___________________________________= Notes on \"Reusable Choices\" dropdown fields:\n\n 1. Dropdowns using a \"Reusable Choices\" list can have multiple levels (e.g. for locations that might have Region and City), different fields can use one or more of the levels (e.g. if you have defined Region and City levels, you could have a field that just uses the Region level, and another field that uses both levels), and you do not need to define all levels for all entries (e.g. you could have defined Neighborhood values as a lower level for some larger Cities, but not all Cities need to have Neighborhoods defined).  The number of levels is not limited by Martus, but please note that if you have large amounts of data in your definitions lists, or a large number of levels, performance of certain Martus record operations may be affected.\n\n 2. In this release, we recommend that if you want to change the number of levels in a \"Reusable Choices\" dropdown field when updating a customization, you also change the field tag and/or label so that they are more easily distinguished from each other in searching and reporting.  If you do not, the search/report results may be confusing since fields with the same label/tag will be treated differently due to them having a different number of levels.\n\n 3. \"Reusable Choices\" codes have the same restrictions that field tags do; they can be in any language, but cannot contain spaces, special characters, or punctuation.\n\n 4. Please make sure to not use the same codes in Reusable Choices lists if you edit your customizations unless you are just fixing typos in the labels, because using the same code for different labels can cause confusion when searching or reporting on those fields. Ideally you should use codes that are not numeric, but are letters that are a meaningful abbreviation of the label so there is no confusion over what they stand for if you update the customization at a later date (e.g. use 2 or 3 letter abbreviations for locations instead of numbers).  See the \"Search\" Help screen for more information about how code and label choices can affect searching on these fields.\n\n 5. You cannot use a multiple level / reusable choice dropdown as a data source for another dropdown inside or outside of grids. If you try to do this you will see an error message.\n\n 6. Please note that when you save customization XML with a Reusable Choices list for dropdown fields, Martus will move those choice definitions to the bottom of the XML when you reload it.\n\n

#______________________________=---Search tips---\n\nMartus will find any text you enter whether it's a complete word or part of a larger word. For example, if you search for the word prison, you'll see records that include the words prison, imprison, and imprisonment. Likewise, if you search for the word prison, Martus will find records that include attachments with names such as photos-prison.jpg and prisoners-report.doc.\n\nTo search for an exact phrase, type it with quotation marks around the phrase  (e.g.  \"Witness Testimony\"). If you do not put quotation marks around the phrase, Martus will search for the words individually.\n\nUse the word \"#Or#\" to broaden your search, or the word \"#And#\" to narrow it.  You can use the #And# / #Or# dropdowns to specify different fields you want search across (e.g. you want to search for records that have \"Last Saved Date\" in the last week and have a certain author).  If you want to search on multiple text values within a single record field, you can use #Or# or #And# in-between words in the \"Search For...\" entry box.  For example, if you search \"Any Field\" for:\n   prison #Or# jail\nyou'll see a list of records that contain either word anywhere in the record. If you search for:\n   prison #And# assault \nyou'll see a list of records that contain both words. The keyword \"#And#\" is implied, so if you search for:\n   prison assault \nMartus will find the same records as if you searched for:\n   prison #And# assault\n\nWhen you use both \"#And#\" and \"#Or#\", your search terms are grouped from the beginning of your list (either across record fields or within a particular field). For example, if you enter:\n   prison #Or# jail #And# trial \nin the \"Search For...\" entry box, Martus will search for any records that contain either of the words prison or jail, and also contain the word trial. But if you enter:\n   prison #And# jail #Or# trial \nMartus will search for any records that contain both the words prison and jail, or contain the word trial.\n

For example, if you want to search for a specific victim name in a single item in your records created after a certain date, select the checkbox and enter the following fields in the Search screen: \"Victim Information: First Name\" = x and \"Victim Information: Last Name\" = y and \"Date Created\" >= YYYY-Mon-DD. If you do not select the \"Match multi-item list details\" checkbox, Martus will find records created after your specified date where any item has the first name you specified and any other item has the last name specified, but not necessarily in the same item (you could have an item with \"First Name\" = x and \"Last Name\" = b, and a different item with \"First Name\" = a and \"Last Name\" = y, and Martus will find that record as matching the search because you did not specify that it had to match in a single item)\n\n

#______________________________= Additional Search Notes:\n\n 1. Because Martus searches all details of any multi-item list for your criteria, it may find records where one item detail matches your criteria but other details do not. For example you could have a record with an item that has a location field in it and you have multiple details in the item with locations A, B, and C. If you search for records where location != C (does not equal C), Martus will find that record because there are 2 details in the record item where the location is not C, even though there is one item where the locations IS C.\n\n 2. In this release, if you are searching on a multi-level dropdown, all searches are exact matches, not partial or \"starts with\" matches. This means that you have to pick the exact level at which you want to be searching. For example, an \"Event Location\" field that has three levels (Region/City/Neighborhood) will have three entries in the search field list: Event Location: Region, Event Location: City, and Event Location: Neighborhood. So if you want to find any records that have an Event Location anywhere in Region X (regardless of the City), you have to pick the \"Event Location: Region\" field to search on and pick Region X off the dropdown list choices. If you pick Event Location: City to search on and then pick Region X but leave the City level blank, Martus will only find entries where there was no City data entered (City was blank), as opposed to ANY location with Region X regardless of what data was entered at the City level.\n\n 3. If you do not see your search terms/dates in the final version of the record displayed in the Search Results folder, your criteria may have been matched in an earlier version of the record. You can access previous versions by clicking the \"Record Details\" button at the bottom of the record. To search only the most recent versions of records, select \"Only search most recent version of records\" in the Search dialog box.\n\n 4. If you have fields in different records or from different customizations that are exactly the same, Martus will combine them in any Search and Report field lists. And while Martus warns you about duplicate labels when you are creating a new record customization, it is possible that over time, you may have records with different customizations that ended up with the same labels (e.g. maybe you changed a text field to a dropdown field but kept the same label). In these cases, Martus will display both fields in the search screen, and try to help you figure out the difference between the fields by displaying what the field type and tag are in the field selection lists. Also, if you have fields with the same tag but different labels and/or field types, Martus may use the tag and field type to try and determine when different fields were meant to be the same. So we encourage you to make your field tags and labels in a customization clearly related to each other to avoid any confusion.\n\n 5. You may sometimes see duplicate entries in dropdown list search criteria values in the search screen. If you pick a Reusable Choices dropdown field to search on, the values that are displayed as the criteria dropdown list options are the labels for each list entry, but the codes you defined determine how many entries there will be in the search dropdown list. So if you have different Reusable Choices codes with the same label in different record customizations in your account, the labels will show up twice in search dropdown lists (i.e. if you used label1 for both code1 and code2, you will see 2 entries in the search dropdown that looks like \"label1\" and your search will be on records that have that label, regardless of which code the customization had for the label). And if you have the same Reusable Choices code with different labels in different record customizations in your account, the search dropdown list for that code will show both values separated by a semicolon (i.e. if you used code1 for both label1 and label2, you will see an entry in the search dropdown that looks like \"label1; label2\" and your search will be on records that have either of those labels).\n\nFor additional help with searching, see the documentation at martus.org or email martus@benetech.org.
-3d76- Additional Search Notes:\n\n 1. Because Martus searches all details of any multi-item list for your criteria, it may find records where one item detail matches your criteria but other details do not. For example you could have a record with an item that has a location field in it and you have multiple details in the item with locations A, B, and C. If you search for records where location != C (does not equal C), Martus will find that record because there are 2 details in the record item where the location is not C, even though there is one item where the locations IS C.\n\n 2.
